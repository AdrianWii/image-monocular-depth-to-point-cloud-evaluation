## Overview

This repository contains data and code for evaluating 3D reconstruction methods using monocular depth estimation and photogrammetry. The data includes
single outdoor images used for generating point clouds through monocular depth estimation models as well as a set of images with a resolution of 480x853 pixels, used to create reference point clouds via photogrammetry techniques.
Scripts and tools for processing the images, generating point clouds are also included.
